# Viseois | Integer Sequence Visualization
Fetches integer sequences from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and plots them using D3.js. Options to view a specific sequence or fetch a random sequence, and to view in linear/logarithmic scale.

Each sequence entry in OEIS does have a "graph" feature, but I found that it's rather slow and is a raster image. A simple weekend project built with React.
